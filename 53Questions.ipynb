    "- Lists have order. They are an ordered sequences, typically of the same type of object. Ie: all user names ordered by creation date, [\"Seth\", \"Ema\", \"Eli\"]\n",
    "- Tuples have structure. Different data types may exist at each index. Ie: a database record in memory, (2, \"Ema\", \"2020–04–16\") # id, name, created_at"
